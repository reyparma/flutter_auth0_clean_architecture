This application uses Auth0 for authentication, BloC for state management and Go_Router for navigation.  It is designed according to clean architecture principles.

Before running this app, make sure you have configured an application and created a user on the Auth0 dashboard with your account.  You can find instructions in my previous article [Flutter Web Authentication Using Auth0, BloC and Go_Router](https://medium.com/@reyparma_53717/flutter-web-authentication-using-auth0-bloc-and-go-router-62d7ebc91e7a) if you need help.
